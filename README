Ignore this repository, and look at the original instead.

Still here?

Ok. I'll explain.

I'm teaching ruby to a classmate, and this is a project he's doing in that class (Computer Technology if you must ask), and this fork is me doing what I think is the best (but might end up not being so), then I'll explain / teach him what I've done, and he'll push his code (which might be slightly different) to PK1312/xcrawl. So look there.
